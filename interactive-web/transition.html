        Australian authors including Peter Carey, Helen Garner, Tim Winton, Jane Harper and Miles Franklin have been swept up in a Silicon-Valley-based AI scandal.

Analysis of a dataset of pirated ebooks, known as Books3, has revealed works by some of the world's most successful authors, including John Grisham, Colleen Hoover and Stephen King, have been used to train generative AI.

"[We know] AI systems are trained by ingesting vast amounts of text … scraped from the internet," says Olivia Lanchester, CEO of the Australian Society of Authors (ASA).

"But the lack of transparency over what has been used to train generative AI means that authors haven't known whether their works have been used."
